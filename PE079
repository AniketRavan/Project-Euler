The text file contains a reasonably small number of entries. And the best part is that the numbers in the key don't repeat.
I made two columns for every number: one for all numbers before that number and the other for all numbers after that number.
For example:

 **Digits before 7**                        **Digits after 7**
      None                                     3,1,6,2,8,9,0
Since digits after 7 are the only digits that appear in the text file, we can say with certainty that 7 is the first digit of the key. 
Once you note down 7, strike it off from all columns. Similarly, you can work out the last digit of the key. Work your way inwards by 
finding the digit next to the one you know with certainty by taking help from these columns. Hardly takes 5 minutes!
